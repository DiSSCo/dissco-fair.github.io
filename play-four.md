## Play Four: Giving access to data
### When to use this Play? 

- When all data has been collected, processed, and analysed.
- When ready to share data with collaborators
- Using the data within different workflows (not necessarily through public repositories)


### Key steps:

1. Think about different levels of data access: who needs access, how?
2. Think about the data embargo situation.
3. Think about sensitive data and ethical issues.
4. Licence (open access, CC0 etc.)
5. Often data can be closed but metadata can be open. Check those cases.
6. Do you know the data citation schema and mechanisms?
7. Do you need to give access to the software along with data?

still be FAIR.
2. Not all repositories are created and operated equally.Check
policies and services.
3. Start documentation earlier in the process
4. Test different access scenarios and report (to the repository
maintainers) if you notice any problems with data submission and
access.
