<h3>Inspiration from the FAIR Cookbook</h3>

<p>Much like the <a href="https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/">FAIR Cookbook</a>, this playbook follows a <strong>"recipe" approach</strong>, guiding you step-by-step through different stages of research data management. Each "Play" provides you with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear, actionable steps</strong> for tasks like data creation, preservation, or sharing</li>
  <li><strong>Key considerations</strong> to ensure compliance with FAIR principles</li>
  <li><strong>Links to resources</strong> and external tools to help you along the way</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sharing Your Playbook</h3>

<p>Once customized, your organization can share its own version of the playbook with internal teams, collaborators, or publicly on GitHub to foster knowledge exchange on FAIR data management practices.</p>
