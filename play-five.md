### Key steps:

2. Use guidelines and best practices from your community. For example, data citation
practices.
3. Data harmonisation steps: If re-using other data sources or your data will be re-used by
others, think about how to combine different data types and terminologies.
4. Think about data formats and legacy data: Are there data readability and format issues?
Do legacy data need to be captured? Are there non digitised data sources?
